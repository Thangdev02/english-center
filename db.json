Some individuals believe that the administration should issue a complete ban on mobile phones in publicly accessible places, including libraries and public transports. I cannot entirely agree with this perspective in some instances.</p><p class='ql-align-justify'>On the one hand, allowing mobile phones in public areas might benefit travelers, customers, and the community. Firstly, it could significantly enhance the traveler experience as visitors in understaffed public spaces could conveniently use their handheld devices to access essential information and instructions on the site without bothering any staff to ask for their help. For example, visitors to museums could simply scan QR codes to explore the information about painters and their masterpieces, or shoopers could use their phone to navigate and locate products in department stores. Secondly, during public health crises, like the Covid-19 pandemic, using phones in public areas could reduce unnecessary contact, contributing to contain the transmission of the virus in the community. For stance, ticket collectors could scan the e-ticket code by bus riders instead of collecting traditional paper tickers, or customers could pay their bill at shops and restaurants by scanning QR codes with their smartphones rather than using physical cards or cash.</p><p class='ql-align-justify'>On the other hand, I still argue that the ubiquitous mobile phones could degrade the public perception of public space as they create portable personal territories. Cellphone users might be under the illusion that they have privacy even in public areas, so they are more likely to violate social norms about having disruptive, private phone calls. They could also become more detached from the surroundings as they are engrossed in texting or browsing websites. As the discrepancy of public and private spheres might become less transparent, while the role of public spaces in educating people about how to behave and interact with those different from themselves might be incredibly hindered if smartphone users no longer feel they need communication with strangers. By banning mobile devices in public sites, organization and the administration could keep the public in the oublic sphere, and actively encourage people to observe and interact with one another.</p><p class='ql-align-justify'>In conclusion, while mobile phones could be beneficial to visitors’ experience and help contain the spread of virus during public health crises, I still believe that banning these devices could preserve the public spheres’ originality and enhance social interactions.</p><p><br></p>"
